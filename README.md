# Simple Guide to Knowing Scams: Can You Spot a Scam?
With personal experience from working at Best Buy, I encountered many people who had fallen for online scams and needed a rundown on information about scams. This is a minimal information website made to help with that, focused on the older generation and people who need to help them.
Although the page doesn't go into anything deep, the information is something everyone should keep in mind these days when interacting with anything online. As mentioned on the page, billions were lost the past year in 2024 to cybercrime. Scams are evolving and getting smarter and general information on how to look for them in layman terms and in a quick way is to help people keep track of that, but not everyone may know how to look for a scam. Many current websites that go over this information spread it out in large texts that many people don't want to bother slowing down and reading or throw out terms that not everyone may be familiar with unless that they grew up with it. Although I was mainly motivated by my experience as a geeksquad employee, that also motivated me to make this.

# Components
There are 4 features on this website. 

## 1) Credible Source of Information
The big selling point of my site is the minimalistic feature. However, if people wanted to read up more on why scams should be something everyone should look out for, this component provides that. An additional functionality to it was to catch people's eyes. Overall, I chose a warm color scheme for the subtle alertness that comes with it. I used mostly orange but I painted this component specifically hello to focus the attention on it to have users be alert to the fact that anyone - no matter your age - can fall for a scam.

## 2) Donation Bait
First off, there is no official charity to donate to scam victims. At most, you might find some people on a charity website like gofundme, but there is no official organization to donate to. When you search it up, most of the results guid you to the Federal Trade Commission to give you instructions on what where to go and what to do if you've been scammed. I actually initially had a QR code that would lead you to one of those but I scrapped it because I wanted to mostly focus on the learning part of the website.

This component is to simulate the scam of supposedly donating for a cause. No where does it say where the money goes it. Should you garner enough sympathy and donate, it will inform you to be wary and research if you're donating.

## 3) "Checklist" 
This listed common features of a scam website and what most people looked out for on a website. I looked into a lot more websites then what I listed but these were two big ones. I kept the information very minimal with the theme of "checklist" and avoided using terms like domain to keep things simple. 

[5 URL Warning Signs - University of Denver](https://www.du.edu/it/services/security/5-url-warning-signs) <br>
[Check If a Website Is Safe - Norton](https://us.norton.com/blog/how-to/check-if-a-website-is-safe)

<br><br>

After you click one of the clues, it will open up more information to check off on for that website component and highlight it on the pseudo scam website photo next to it.

### URL Misspellings
URL is usually an easy tell. But if you hadn't grown up with it, you might not know about it. I know I did not know about the common shortened URLs at a point in time.

### Security Certificate (SSL)
This was one I didn't think people looked at or even knew about since the URL usually gives it away pretty easily. I looked at multiple browsers - Microsoft Edge, Chrome, FireFox, Opera - and they all had it in the same place, but not all of them used the same icons to represent them. Even if you didn't click on the button, you can still open up the SSL. Another thing on the "To Do in the Future" docket is making the fake scam website more interactible.

###  Pressures You 
This had a lot of unearthed potential. I had a deadline for this so I didn't get around to doing this, but I had really wanted to simulate a scam overloading your computer with a bunch of arbritrary processes or maybe it forked the computer. It would have multiple scam popups show up on top of each other and blare a loud noise. Panic is such a big tool of online scams. They don't want you to think and want you to act fast - unwisely. Even if you know what to do, loud noises can startle anyone. Even outside of websites, they can call you repeatedly when you're sleeping to get you're attention or text you with "urgent problem" messages.

## 4) Tips
Having glimpsed pieces of it in some of the previous photos, you might have be wondering what they're saying.

Personally, I feel like these are common sense, just written a little more out. But, most of the older folk who came in when I had been working were about Microsoft scams. Microsoft is pretty easy to look up - especially as a big corporation - and this is why they don't want you to think and research. If they ever try to freeze your computer that was what the second image tip is for. 

# Brainstorming Process
For my brainstorming process, I had some rough ideas but didn't know how to lay them out and used figma sketch to help see it on screen. 

At the start, I wanted to make the site a bit interactible instead of just showing information. I played with the idea of QR codes and also wanted the user to be able to interact with an image of a scam website to know how to identify and deal with one. I was thinking maybe this is a public interactive board and qr codes are great for accessing websites on the go and don't need you to type in the link yourself. A big feature I wanted was to make a fake scam screen to help people identify features of a scam and perhaps make it interactible. Another one was to let users print off a checklist pdf to check if a website was a scam, since many older folk like physical paper. I unfortunately didn't get around to it, but if I come back to this, it would be something I would add. <br> <br>

I rubber ducked with some friends and came up with the donation bait, which I considered using a QR code for. But after looking into QR codes, I thought it would be more efficient to just have it all on the same website to simulate the experience. The reset of the components were added up in the coding process.

![Screenshot 2024-12-09 193027](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17ece608-06be-4d4b-8e28-d3eb4cd6438f)

The contents of the checklist was decided later after researching into what common things websites were telling people to look out for. I had cut off "Unsafe Website Warning" because it was something that automatically happens when visiting a shady website and not something to lookout for on a shady website. "Rushes You to Do Something" and "Pops Up Out of Nowhere" were comboed into the "Pressures You" because the first was a bit too long and the second felt like it was part of the tactics to pressure people anyways.

# Color 
I mentioned earlier, but I went for a orange-y warm color scheme with blue font/accents. I went with a cold/hot combo because the warm tones gave off subtle warning feelings. I didn't want to go outride red because that felt too much and would scare people. The blue was to make things more readable and make the overall site more cozy feeling. Initally, I had it as the dominant tone but changed it later because everything looked like it was clashing together.

# Svelte + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Svelte in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Svelte](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode).

## Need an official Svelte framework?

Check out [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit#readme), which is also powered by Vite. Deploy anywhere with its serverless-first approach and adapt to various platforms, with out of the box support for TypeScript, SCSS, and Less, and easily-added support for mdsvex, GraphQL, PostCSS, Tailwind CSS, and more.

## Technical considerations

**Why use this over SvelteKit?**

- It brings its own routing solution which might not be preferable for some users.
- It is first and foremost a framework that just happens to use Vite under the hood, not a Vite app.

This template contains as little as possible to get started with Vite + Svelte, while taking into account the developer experience with regards to HMR and intellisense. It demonstrates capabilities on par with the other `create-vite` templates and is a good starting point for beginners dipping their toes into a Vite + Svelte project.

Should you later need the extended capabilities and extensibility provided by SvelteKit, the template has been structured similarly to SvelteKit so that it is easy to migrate.

**Why `global.d.ts` instead of `compilerOptions.types` inside `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json`?**

Setting `compilerOptions.types` shuts out all other types not explicitly listed in the configuration. Using triple-slash references keeps the default TypeScript setting of accepting type information from the entire workspace, while also adding `svelte` and `vite/client` type information.

**Why include `.vscode/extensions.json`?**

Other templates indirectly recommend extensions via the README, but this file allows VS Code to prompt the user to install the recommended extension upon opening the project.

**Why enable `checkJs` in the JS template?**

It is likely that most cases of changing variable types in runtime are likely to be accidental, rather than deliberate. This provides advanced typechecking out of the box. Should you like to take advantage of the dynamically-typed nature of JavaScript, it is trivial to change the configuration.

**Why is HMR not preserving my local component state?**

HMR state preservation comes with a number of gotchas! It has been disabled by default in both `svelte-hmr` and `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte` due to its often surprising behavior. You can read the details [here](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-hmr/tree/master/packages/svelte-hmr#preservation-of-local-state).

If you have state that's important to retain within a component, consider creating an external store which would not be replaced by HMR.

```js
// store.js
// An extremely simple external store
import { writable } from 'svelte/store'
export default writable(0)
```
